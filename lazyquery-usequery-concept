React Query
React Query is a powerful library for managing server state in React applications. It simplifies data fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating data in your application.

Key Features:
Data Fetching: React Query abstracts the process of fetching data, making it easy to use within React components.
Caching: Automatically caches the fetched data and reuses it until it becomes stale. This minimizes unnecessary network requests.
Background Synchronization: Keeps the data in sync by refetching it in the background if necessary.
Automatic Refetching: Can refetch data when certain events occur, such as window focus, network reconnection, or a specific interval.
Optimistic Updates: Temporarily update the UI while waiting for the server response, and roll back if the request fails.
Pagination and Infinite Query: Built-in support for pagination and infinite scrolling.



import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

function fetchData() {
  return fetch('https://api.example.com/data').then(response => response.json());
}

function MyComponent() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery('fetchData', fetchData);

  if (isLoading) return <span>Loading...</span>;
  if (error) return <span>Error: {error.message}</span>;

  return (
    <div>
      {data.map(item => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}


Explanation:
useQuery: This hook is used to fetch data and manage its state. It accepts a unique key ('fetchData') and a function to fetch data (fetchData).
The hook returns the data, error, and isLoading states, which you can use to conditionally render your UI.


Lazy Query in React
Lazy Query refers to a query that is not executed immediately when a component mounts. Instead, it's executed on demand, typically in response to a user action like a button click.

Use Case:
When you donâ€™t want to fetch data automatically when the component loads, but only when a certain condition is met, such as a user clicking a button or submitting a form.


Explanation:
useLazyQuery: Unlike useQuery, this hook does not automatically execute when the component renders. Instead, it returns a function (getData in the example) that you can call when you want to execute the query.
The query will only execute when getData is invoked, allowing more control over when data fetching occurs.
Comparison
React Query: Primarily used for automatically fetching, caching, and syncing data from REST APIs or other endpoints when the component mounts or when specified triggers occur. It is well-suited for managing server state and reducing the need for manual state management.

Lazy Query: Used when you want to delay data fetching until a specific event happens (like a button click). It provides more control over when queries are executed, making it useful for scenarios where immediate data fetching is not desired.

Both concepts serve different purposes, and the choice between them depends on your use case and the specific requirements of your application.
